## Third-party components

The shipped extension does not bundle Electron, Node.js, or a browser runtime.
It runs inside the host browser and uses that browser's extension APIs
(`cookies`, `activeTab`, `scripting`). Those APIs are provided by the host
browser, not vendored in this tree.

Dev-only Node scripts under `scripts/` are not included in the store zip. They
are MIT-licensed project tooling and are not a runtime dependency of the
extension.

Image and icon assets under `icons/` and `assets/` are project brand assets —
see [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md).
